            Whether Standard, Miniature, or Toy, and either black, white, or
            apricot, the Poodle stands proudly among dogdom’s true aristocrats.
            Beneath the curly, low-allergen coat is an elegant athlete and
            companion for all reasons and seasons. Poodles come in three size
            varieties: Standards should be more than 15 inches tall at the
            shoulder; Miniatures are 15 inches or under; Toys stand no more than
            10 inches. All three varieties have the same build and proportions.
            At dog shows, Poodles are usually seen in the elaborate Continental
            Clip. Most pet owners prefer the simpler Sporting Clip, in which the
            coat is shorn to follow the outline of the squarely built, smoothly
            muscled body. Forget those old stereotypes of Poodles as sissy dogs.
            Poodles are eager, athletic, and wickedly smart “real dogs” of
            remarkable versatility. The Standard, with his greater size and
            strength, is the best all-around athlete of the family, but all
            Poodles can be trained with great success.
