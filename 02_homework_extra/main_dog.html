        The Beagle is a sturdy, hardy little hound dog that looks like a miniature
        Foxhound. The body is squarely-built while the skull is fairly long and
        slightly domed. The square muzzle is straight and medium in length. The
        large eyes are brown or hazel and are set well apart. The wide, pendant
        ears are low set and long. The black nose is broad with full nostrils. The
        feet are round and firm. The tail is set moderately high and never curled
        over the back. The coat is of medium length, close, hard, sleek and easy
        to care for. Any hound-type of coloring is acceptable including lemon,
        tricolor, black and tan, red and white, orange and white or lemon and
        white, blue tick and red tick. Beagles have a distinct howl / bay of a
        bark when they are on the hunt.
