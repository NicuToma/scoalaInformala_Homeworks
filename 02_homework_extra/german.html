            Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German
            Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and
            high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the
            German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs
            can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in
            outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than
            angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn
            it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons
            why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but
            experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage,
            confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the
            willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones.
            German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians,
            but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does
            not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.
